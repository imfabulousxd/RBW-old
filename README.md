# RBW-old
This bot is very poorly coded but works for the most part so just thought I would release it because either ways I'm coding a new one with better database handling and better everything basically

**Just saying I'm not trying to fix any bugs that might exist so just dont request it.**

make sure to setup config.py before u start the bot (don't change things u dont know anything about)
if you edit it you'll have to restart it

for the cards you will have to use =_sqlquery and insert the card to the cards TABLE and put the card file in `Guilds/{guild_id}/Cards`

daily and weekly leaderboards are broken (probably).

make sure to =setinfo,=setchannel,=setrole everything there

If you wanna use this... all i gotta say is good luck.
